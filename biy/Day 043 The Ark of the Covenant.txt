Exodus 25-26, Leviticus 19, Psalm 119:1-56

It might be hard to picture how the tabernacle. We have not seen the artist rendering of these things.

The veil that seperates the holy place from the holy of holies (containing only the Ark of the Covenant).
	This veil was torn in two, top to bottom, when Jesus gave up His spirit to the Father, and thereby He poured out his mercy seat on the Ark of the covenant (Even though it was hidden away at this point)
	The idea is the same. The mercy of God being poured out upon the world as the veil of his flesh is pierced by that soldier's spear and the blood and water flows out.
		The blood of Eucharist and the water of baptism. That the holy of holies is being revealed, not because it is no longer holy, but because it is no longer off-limits.
		Here is God's love that is impossible to hold back anymore.

Exo 25:30 - Table for the bread of the presence
	You shall set the bread of the presence on the table before me always.
	In all Catholic Churches, we have the bread of the presence, Jesus who continues to dwell with us anymore.

Levi 19 - Confusing moments
	Don't shave off the hair on your temples.
	God has to start somewhere. Might seem unfair.
	You shall be just to the poor.
	God has to teach His people justice before He can teach them mercy. He has to teach us what right and wrong are before He can teach us the subtle nuances of the truth, justice and goodness.
