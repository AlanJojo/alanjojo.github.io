Genesis 20-21, Job 9-10, Proverbs 2:6-8

Abraham - father of faith
	We see him walking in faith. We also sees him faltering in faith.
	He passes of Sarah as merely his sister out of fear.

Gen 20:6 - God says to Abim'elech: It was I who kept you from sinning against me.
	God has held us back from falling even when we didn't know. At times, God allows us to, so as to learn from failure.
	Abraham's failure to have trust in Lord did not disqualify him from the covenant.

Job - Says things which many of us are afraid to say: I don't understand God. Are you not on my side? I feel powerless. Why do you not care?
	Answer will be found when we journey with him, in his pain and in his feeling in being abandoned.
	Quick answer is found in Proverbs: If you are just, you get blessed. If you are wicked, you don't get blessed.

God causes rain to fall on good and evil. He shines the sun on the just and unjust. There's a mystery.

There's so much we don't understand about life. Yet, the more we don't run from God, the more we stay to Him, the better.
