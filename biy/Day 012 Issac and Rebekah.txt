Genesis 24, Job 13-14, Proverbs 2:16-19

The story of the servant of Abraham finding Issac a bride is all about God's providence.
	Going to far off lan; knows nobody
	Prays for help
	Clearly Rebekah is meant for Issac

God's providence is working in all situations. The invitation is to continue to give praise even when we don't necessarily understand what God is doing.

Job - I would understand if I had done something wrong. That makes sense. But, this doesn't make sense. Are you fighthing against me? Or are you fighthing for me?
	It is one thing to praise God when we see His presence, it's one thing to praise God when we understand His work, His providence.
	But it is another thing to say: "I am in the darkness. I do not get this. Yet, you are calling me to keep one foot in front of the other".
	Maybe today's the day we just have to keep walking forward in the darkness. And we never forget in the darkness what we knew was true in the light.
