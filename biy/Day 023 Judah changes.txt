Genesis 43-44, Job 35-36, Proverbs 4:10-19

Originally, the other brothers were jealous of the love their their father had for the 11th brother, Joseph.
	They were willing to kill him untill they sold him into slavery.
	Yet, something has changed in their lives and hearts when the youngest(Benjamin) who also is beloved by their father has his life threatened and their fathers life by extension.
	Earlier, they didn't care that thier father was heartbroken. Earlier, they didn't care that their father was grieved by the news of Joseph's death.
	Something must have changed in their lives when Joseph was away. They put their lives on the line for their father's beloved son(Benjamin).
	This demonstrates that these men have changed.

Gospel reveals that even though we are messy, we can change.
	Here, the person who puts his life on line is Judah, who on Gen 38 has sexual relation with his daughter-in-law Tamar thinking that she was a prostitute.
	Here Judah puts his life on the line for his father, for Benjamin and for his other brothers.

With God's help, we can change. Judah had fallen seriously. Now, he is a shining son. He is someone who we can look upon now.
None of us has to remain stuck in sin.
