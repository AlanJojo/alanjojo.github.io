Genesis 12-13, Job 1-2, Proverbs 1:1-7

Abraham - There is still the brokenness (passing off Sarah as his sister in Egypt) (not perfect).
satan - The adversary -> (ha-satan) The accuser

Prayer:
	Lord, make my heart more and more like Job's that when I experience suffering, I worship.
	Make my heart like Abraham's that when I don't know which way to go and need to be corrected, that I allow myself to be corrected by You and trust in You.
