Exodus 17-18, Leviticus 12, Psalm 73

There are people who want to demystify the miracles.
	Crossing of Red Sea - They tell that it was a natural phenomena where there is a mighty wind. The tide in the Red sea dries up a section of it and you can walk across it.
		Note:- Then it is a miracle that all Egyptians drowned in 2 inches of water.
	Manna - That there are bugs that secrete this and we can find this in the desert in the morning.
	The miracles are a supernatural phenomena.
	The war with Amalek - Moses raises the staff - No natural explanation to it

Levi 12 - Woman being unclean after conception.
	Not in a moral way. Doesn't mean immoral/bad.
	Unclean in Jewish concept - Can a person approach the temple? Are they clean to approach?
	Cleanliness is associated with life/death for Jews.
		If one comes in contact with animal carcass - death
		After pregnancy - life
		Bodily fluids were generally associated with life.
