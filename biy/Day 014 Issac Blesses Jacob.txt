Genesis 27-28, Job 17-18, Proverbs 3:1-4

Christianity is post-Judaism. We believe that the story of Abraham, Issac and Jaocb is our story.
	St. Paul says in his letter to the Romans: As gentile Christians, we have been grafted on to that family tree in the process of salvation that God had begun.

Story of grasper, Jacob.
	Decieves his father out of the blessing.
	Issac didn't take Jacob's blessing back. This is in so many ways the basis for our sacraments.
		In Judaism, a Jewish male was brought into the covenant by circumcision, something you can't undo.
		As Christians, we are brought into the covenant/family of God by Baptism. You can't undo it.
	Issac might regret that he gave the blessing to the one who decieved him out of the blessing. At the same time, it was a true blessing. He knows that he can't undo the blessing.
		Even if someone says that they renounce their baptism, baptism can't be undone.
		Even if someone says that they don't want to be part of the covenant, that they don't want to be the child of God, they can't.
