Genesis 35-36, Job 25-26, Proverbs 3:19-24

We see the death of Rachel and the birth of Benjamin.
We have the death of Issac and the account of Esau's descendants. Why? That wasn't the line of blessing.
	Gen 36 - Even though Esau didn't recieve the blessing, he is the son of his father and the grandson of Abraham. God is keeping His promise that he will multiply their descendants.
God is faithful and He is steadfast.
