Exodus 6-7, Leviticus 5, Psalm 47

God has to make Moses remember who He is.

Leviticus - God is so gracious even in His mercy.
	If you can't afford a bull, offer 2 pigeons. If you can't even offer it, bring an offering of fine flour. What I want for you is to give you my mercy.
	Offer what you can.
