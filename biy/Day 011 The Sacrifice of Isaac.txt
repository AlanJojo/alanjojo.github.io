Genesis 22-23, Job 11-12, Proverbs 2:9-15

Gen 22:3 - Abraham has a profound trust in God. He reveals his faith here. He is not under the impression that God is going to take away Issac
	Gen 22:5 - He tells the 2 young men: We are gonna both come back to you.
	Heb 11:19 - Abraham knew that even if he sacrificed, God had the power over life and death.
	shows Abraham's deep and profound faith in God.
	This story has a deep meaning. This sets up the context for virtually everything in the spiritual life.
	Art might depict the story differently. An old man Abraham sacrificing a "child" Issac, with him bound up and struggling.
	This is not merely the story of a father willing to sacrifice his son. This is the story of a father-son team.
		We know Issac is not a child(possibly, in his 30s) who was overpowered by his father. In fact, if anything Issac is the one who is stronger(compared to Abraham the old man).
		Reason: When they go up the mountain, Abraham laid up the wood for sacrifice in the back of Issac.
		Issac submitted to being bound his father and laid down willingly for sacrifice.

This is setting up the stage for the eternal father with His only beloved, begotten Son and the sacrifice of the Son and the Father at Calvary(Golgotha). (John 3:16)
	This is unmistakably a preparation for Christ's sacrifice.
	This is a revelation about how the Father in Heaven and the Son cooperates in bringing about salvation.
	Gen 22:6 - Issac walks up with the wood of sacrifice outside Mount Mori'ah.
		Outside Jerusalem we see Jesus, the Son walking up with the wood of cross on his back up on Mount Mori'ah.
		Calvary and Mori'ah are part of the same mountain range, right outside the city of Jerusalem.
	The point is: Trust
	God is not your enemy. This is where Job struggles with.
	Just before the night of cruxifiction, Jesus prays: Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; neverthless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
