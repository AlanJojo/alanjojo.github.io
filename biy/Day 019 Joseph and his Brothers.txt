Genesis 37, Job 27-28, Proverbs 3:25-27

Joseph is beloved by Israel as he is the youngest and he isn't liked much by his brothers.
When we think that someone else has something that we belive is ours, it leads us to resentment.
	Jealousy lead to envy which lead to resentment and this lead them to plan for Joseph's murder.
	Life is a gift and it is not owed to me.
