Genesis 18-19, Job 7-8, Proverbs 2:1-5

Gen 18:2 - 3 men. We don't know who they are. We know their role. Their role is to enact justice, not vengeance.
	Justice - Giving someone what is due
	Vengeance - Simply taking out anger upon somebody
	Here, justice is clearly established.
	Abraham asks God and God tells that even if there are 10 righteous people, the city won't be destroyed.

Gen 19:8 - Lot offers up his daughters to the men. How is that good?
	It ain't. Just because something is in the Bible, doesn't mean that it is good. But we can still learn from it.

Gen 19:31 - Daughters of Lot
	Had relation with their father to continue their bloodline.
	We don't have the Bible telling that it was wrong. The Bible shows us that it was the wrong thing.
		The result of the incest is the Moabites and Ammonites, who became the enemy of Israelites.

Job - Bildad defends God's justice.
	Job doesn't appreciate the answer.

The question the book of Job raises: If God is good, why is there evil in the world?
	Not going to end with an answer. We are going on a journey with Job.
	Hint: The answer isn't why. It's who.
