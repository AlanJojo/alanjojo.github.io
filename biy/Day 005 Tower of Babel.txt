Genesis 10-11, Psalm 2

Psalm 2 along with Psalm 110 - a royal Messianic psalm, often applied to Jesus as Messiah in the New Testament.

Gen 10 - The table of nations makes use of old materials to show how all the nations of the world as then known have descended from the generation that survived the Flood.
Story of descendants of Noah - Shem, Ham and Japheth

Gen 10:25 - Peleg (in Hebrew means division)

Nimrod was a mighty hunter. He created the kingdom in Babel, Erech and Accad all in the land of Shinar.
	Babel is what would come to be Ancient Babylon.
	Nimrod would be the first to become a tyrant in his quest for ambition, in his quest for power, in his quest for control.
	In the heart of Nimrod was what was in the heart of the people who created the tower of Babel - ruthless ambition (not for excellence but for ambition).
	The quest for excellence is what the Lord puts in our hearts. The opposite of which is ruthless ambition.
	(Ancient christian sources indicate that the power Nimrod was given by God(as he was Noah's descendant) was misused by him)

Gen 11 - Hebrew "balal" means confuse
The Tower of Babel
	Key is not that they went on to build the tower. They wanted to build it to make a name for themselves.
	Excellence - wanting a life that glorifies the Lord
	Ambition - wanting a life that simply glorifies self.

Be who you are(what God made you to be) and be that well. But pursue excellence rather than merely pursuing power, influence, fame.

Lord make me a saint and make me a great saint.
