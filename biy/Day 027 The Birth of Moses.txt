Exodus 1-2, Leviticus 1, Psalm 44

We see how deeply invested God is in His people even when they are unfaithful to Him.
	We see that God was still with them and blessed them. They became exceedingly strong and fruitful even when they were being worked.
	Children are a blessing. One of the greatest blessings God can give to a couple.

Levidicus - Starts with the sacrifice of burnt offerings without any preamble. Some parts relates to our worship now.
	The sacrifice is not completed when the animal is killed. The life is in the blood, Levidicus says.
	When we have the presentation in our Holy mass, the priest says: This is my body and blood and evelvates the bread and wine. This is similar to the presentation in Lev 1.
	When the blood is poured out on the alter is when sacrifice is offered to the Lord.
	This is similar to the moment in the Mass where the priest takes our Lord Jesus and says:
		Through Him, with Him and in Him. In the unity of the Holy Spirit. All glory and honor is yours Almighty Father. Amen.
	This is when the blood is being poured out in the alter as offering.
