  Great Adventure timeline - 12 periods
  In the 73 books, not all are equal. All are inspired; but all don't do the same thing.
  Some are narrative, some are prophetic, some are poetry, apocalyptic.
  We pick 14 narrative books and the other 59 books are put in the historical context along with these 14.
  The Early World consists of the first 11 chapters of Genesis (5 days).
    We see themes/patterns that are going to be revisited later in the Bible.
    It is a history of the early world written in a Hebrew poetry form (not just a literal way).
      e.g: The Garden, Adam, Eve, serpent
    When we get into the Patriarchs, itâ€™s written in a more linear way.

  Creation of world -> Creation of Adam and Eve
    Human is created in a different way - In the image and likeness of God, have will, capacity to love and sacrifice
  Caveats: Free to eat of any tree other than Tree of Knowledge and of Good and Evil.
    Chapter 3: Enemy comes in, immediately starts questioning God; and lies.
  Heart of Sin: Pride came in. Lost their trust. Grasping for the creation rather than The Creator.
    Sin changed the relationship with each other, the creations and The Creator.
  Good news: God has a plan of sheer goodness.
  As we see the rest of the Early world play out, we see the results of sin of Adam and Eve.
  We see the plan, the problem with the plan, the solution.

  I know better that God attitude is taken by many characters in the Bible and we see how the effect of their actions.
