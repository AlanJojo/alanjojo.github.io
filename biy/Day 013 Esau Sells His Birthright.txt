Genesis 25-26, Job 15-16, Proverbs 2:20-22

We have Abraham say about Sara: She is father like sister. (to King of Egypt and to Abim'elech)
	Same with Issac about Rebekah (to Abim'elech).
	Like father like son.
	What makes us fall into the exact same trap again and again?

Gen 25:19 - With the birth of Esau and Jacob, we enter a new narrative cycle.
	Jacob, renamed Israel, is represented as the ancestor of the 12 tribes and, therefore, of the whole people.

Jacob - (Hebrew) He takes by the heel/ He supplants

Jacob gives lentil soup in exchange for Esau's birthright.
	Manipulation of Jacob, the grasper
	Esau is impetuous in giving up his birthright.
