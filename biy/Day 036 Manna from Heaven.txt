Exodus 15-16, Leviticus 11, Psalm 71

It's been a few weeks that God has miraculously rescused the Israelites from Egypt.
	They ask: Why didn't we just die back in Egypt?
	Wouldn't it have been better if we had just died as people who are abandoned by Lord rather than being lead by the Lord through these uncomfortable places?

God is not just feeding them, God is also training them. We see how God is taking care, fighting for and trying to teach His people who He is and the degree to which they can trust Him.
	The manna spoils after a day. But on the 6th day, they can collect twice as much for the Sabath. It won't spoil. If they honor God in His Sabath, He will take care of them.
	He is training them in trust.
