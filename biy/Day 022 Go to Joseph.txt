Genesis 41-42, Job 33-34, Proverbs 4:1-9

One of the words in the old testament in the book of Genesis is: "Go to Joseph" (Latin: Ite Ad Joseph)

When we go to Mary, she points us to Jesus.
	There are so many ways in which the Lord God has given us the foster father of Jeus as well.
	Joseph - The one who guarded the bread from heaven to be able to be distributed to people who are dying from hunger.

Joseph fought for God to be with him.
	Joseph had opportunities to sin and to rebel. But, he fought to stay faithful to the Lord and he was faithful to Lord.
