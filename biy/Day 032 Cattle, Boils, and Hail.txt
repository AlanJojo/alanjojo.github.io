Exodus 9, Leviticus 7, Psalm 49

Why is God heardening Pharaoh's heart?
	2 expressions usually come up -
		The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart
		Pharaoh hardened his heart
	Doesn't mean God took away Pharaoh's free will. Doesn't mean God overwhelmed Pharaoh.
	God is always good. God is life itself. It's like the sun. Wax melts in presence of the sun. But clay hardens in the presence of the sun.
		Its mainly about the disposition of the heart. Here, God reveals Himself to the people of Egypt. Yet, Pharaoh obstinately and stubbornly refuses to acknowledge Him.
	Pharaoh allows his heart to be hardened by God's presence.

The challenge is to never let our hearts be hardened by the Lord's presence.
