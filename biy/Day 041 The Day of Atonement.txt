Exodus 23, Leviticus 16, Psalm 77

We not only hear about laws concerning justice, Israelites are commanded to be just and fair in dealing with those who are poor.
	The word tells that to do injustice to those who are poor, or to forsake justice for the sake of the poor are incorrect.
	There is a thing called preferential option for the poor that we as Catholics have, but not to the point where we do injustice for the sake of the poor.
	I know the hardness of your heart and the softness of your heart. A balance is necessary. It's as if God Himself knows the human nature.

Exo 23 - First hint at 3 major festivals: 3 times where Jews were supposed to go to Jerusalem for worship:
	Exo 23:14 Feast of unleavened bread - Passover (Good Friday)
	Exo 16 Feast of the Harvest - Feast of Pentecost (50 days after the feast of the unleavened bread)
	Feast of Ingathering - End of the year - Festival of Tabernacles (least familiar to Catholics)

	Levi 16 - Day of Atonemnent (Yom Kippur)
		End of September. Remembering past sins and making amends. Coming before the Lord and asking for His forgiveness. It is the only day of fasting that's actually decreed in the Bible.

There are some extra-biblical text that tells that Aza'zel (Levi 16:10) is the prince of the fallen angels. Just theory.

Levi 16:7 - There is the scapegoat that carries the sins of the people. This is a foreshadowing of our mass. Jesus is the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
	When the priest offers up the Eucharist, he is offering up the great sacrifice of the lamb of God to the glory of the Father on behalf of the people.
