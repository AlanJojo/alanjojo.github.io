Genesis 39-40, Job 31-32, Proverbs 3:33-35

Joseph has a lot of parallels with the new testament St. Joseph.
	Young Joseph is righteous.
	Consistently choose to walk with the Lord.
	In the midst of this, Joseph has been betrayed by his brothers, he has been sold into slavery, he is falsely accused, he is falsely imprisoned
		All the while, the refrain is: But the Lord God was with him.
	Here is Joseph who is in a terrible situation that he did not create. He is the victim of it.
		He did not live like a victim. He lived like a victor. He lived walking with the Lord. And the Lord was with him.

Job pointed out that he has walked with the Lord and has been righteous. Yet he feels that the Lord was not with him.
	Still, He is confident that He has not left him.

In our situations that are broken; in our situations that are not ideal, we know that The Lord is still with me.
