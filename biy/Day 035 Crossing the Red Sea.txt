Exodus 13-14, Leviticus 10, Psalm 53

Leviticus - Here is God revealing His holiness.
	Levi 10:1 - We have the sons of Aaron who come into the Lord's presence and do whatever they want to do and the fire of the Lord consumes them.
		Seems extreme. In the new covenant, he is so close to us. He came to us as human, born in a stable and brought up in poverty and humility. We tortured and killed Him. We are like, whatever.
		God here says: There is no kind of "whatever" when it comes to approaching me. It is, approach me the way I am telling you to. Because I am holy.

Exodus - We see the miraculous rescue of the people of Israel.
	The Lord fights for you. You only have to stand still.
