Genesis 14-15, Job 3-4, Proverbs 1:8-19

We heard Abraham join the battle of the kings.
Gen 14:18 - We see the priest king, Melchiz'edek, king of Salem blesses Abraham and offers up bread and wine on the high place.
	We see later on, Jesus will be described as having a priesthood according to the order of Melchiz'edek.
	Reasons: Many
		Not inherited priesthood. Melchizedek - (later on scripture says) has no begining nor end.
		Also, this incredible gift of the priest king offers up the sacrifice of bread and wine.
			Later on, Jesus will offer up the sacrifice of blood and wine which is truly his body and blood.
			And at every mass, priest who are united to the great high priest, Jesus, offer up the sacrifice of His body and blood.

Gen 14:9 - We see the incredible covenant that God made with Abraham.
	This is how you would forge a covenant in the ancient world. You would make a path b/w the halves of these animals and walk through the blood and guts in there.
	Essentially saying: "If I am false to this covenant, then let me be as these animals." Lord God Himself passes through that. Incredible.
	We see how broken we are in Genesis 1-11.
	Here, we see God Himself passing through the pieces essentially saying: "I know you are going to be false to this covenant. And so, even your failure take upon me".
	And that's what he does, in the person of Jesus. The Lord God Himself takes our wounds, takes our failings, takes our sins on Himself.

We see Job. He trusted God. Now, he opens up his heart. He wishes that he was never born.
	His friend Eli'phaz says: All suffering is the result of sin.
		We know that's not true. Suffering is a result of sin. Not all suffering is a result of sin. Some suffering is the result of the fact that we live in a broken world.
	We will find later why God has allowed Satan to stretch forth his hand and strike Job down.
		Know that Lord loves Job.
