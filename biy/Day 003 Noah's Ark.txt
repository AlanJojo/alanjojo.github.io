Genesis 5-6, Psalm 136

Genesis 5: These genealogies are selective and schematic, and the numbers are symbolic.
There seem to exists 2 distinct threads of humanity. One from Seth and another from Cain (Cainite line/Kenites).
	A disctinction is made in Chapter 6. The Sethite line could be reffered to as "sons of God". The Cainite line would be reffered to as "the daughters of men".
	Purity - way of life

"Walking with God" - written by Jeff Cavins and Tim Gray
	While modern readers often find geneologies boring reading, they include important details that are often strategically placed to prepare for the narrative that follows.
	Seth is born in Adam's image and likeness.
	These important details are recalled only in Gen 5 (with Seth's line) but not in Gen 4 with Cain's line in order to draw a stark contrast b/w the 2 lines.
	Cain's line produces murderers and polygamists like Lamach. The Nephilim(Hebrew: To fall) may refer to this fallen line.
	Seth's line produces righteous men like Enoch and Noah who worship God and call upon the name of the Lord.					<- Singled out as being in image and likeness of Eve

So, intermarriage caused wickedness to grow among them.
	Who we marry determines, in so many ways, the trajectory of our lives both positively and negatively.

God determined to root out the cancer. Even if the culture around us is wicked, we can choose like Noah to walk with the Lord.

Gen 6:16 - Not just a single window (will be clear upon further study with Hebrew words).
