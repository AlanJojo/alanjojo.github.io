Genesis 47-48, Job 39-40, Psalm 16

The new testament is hidden in the old testament and the old testament is revealed in the new.

Job is seen as been undeservedly punished.
	God in His wisdom has allowed the accuser to deprive Job of his happiness.

While his friends logic is somewhat true, it is not accurate.
	God Himself shows up and He seems to have a little bit of attitude.
	God tells us that there is so much beyond Job. God is not telling not to ask questions.
	God tells: "Job, there are so many elements to this story that you do not know"
	Even though God sounds sarcastic when he puts Job in his place, only God can reveal this to Job as He is the only one who knows the whole story.

Some suffering is oriented towards repentence, some suffering is oriented towards wisdom and growing in knowledge.
	Some suffering is oriented towards breaking our hearts and making us gentler and better people.
	Also, some suffering can be redemptive suffering. They not only transforms us but also can be offered up to God for the salvation of the world.
	This does not explicitly come out in the book of Job. The old testament is revealed in the new and the new testament is hidden in the old.

God knows the full story even when we cannot possibly see the full story.
	And part of that full story is: God can use our suffering for not only His glory, but also for our redemption and for the redemption of the world.
	That is the mystery of the cross.

Let's pray for each other. It is easy to talk about the cross. But it's not easy to carry your cross.
