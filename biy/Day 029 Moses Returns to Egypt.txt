Exodus 4-5, Leviticus 4, Psalm 46

Reveals the sascred name of God to Moses.
	LORD is used reverently. It denotes the proper name revealed to Moses by God.
	YHWH - I am who I am.
	It is important as in the ancient world, they had a deeper appreciation for proper names.
		Knowing one's name was understood as having a personal relationship with that person.
	Here's God, who is revealing Himself.

Exod 4:24 - He appeared in a threatening posture, probably with a sword drawn in his hand, or inflicted upon him some disease which threatened him with death.
	The cause seems to have been Moses’s neglecting to circumcise his son; which, perhaps, was the effect of his being unequally yoked with a Midianite,
		who was too indulgent of her child, and Moses so of her. Now God was offended with him for this neglect of duty, not only because Moses knew that no
		child could be admitted a member of the Israelitish community without circumcision, nor be entitled to the blessings of God’s covenant with Abraham’s seed,
		but also, because Moses’s example was of great consequence.

The goal of freedom is not just simply "freedom for freedom's sake", it is "freedom for"
	Here, freedom for worshipping God.

Anger of people of Israel towards Moses and Aaron - "You have disrupted our lives."

We are Pharaohs to ourselves.
	We make ourselves so busy, as slaves, that we don't have time for God.
	We have made ourselves into slaves.

God has made it clear that we are not meant to be slaves.
