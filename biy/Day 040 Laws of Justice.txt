Exodus 22, Leviticus 15, Psalm 76

The good news is that these laws reveal something about God's heart.
	The principles/laws have to deal with justice, not vengeance. Here, the law tells that there is a limit. We see restraint.

Levi 15 - The bodily emissions are important because they are connected with life. The life is in the blood. They refer to very intrinsic and necessary parts of our relationships.
	4 kinds of bodily emissions are described. 2 for man and 2 for woman.
		1 - (for man) most likely be some kind of venereal disease kind of situation
		2 - (for man) emission of semen
		3 - (for woman) her discharge during mensturation
		4 - (for woman) a chrnic issue of blood not due to menstruation, most likely be venereal disease.
	2 completely fine things and 2 others which would most likely be disease.
	Why these rules? Body is considered sacred. This particular kinds of emissions of body had to do with relationships, sex.
	Here, God's word is telling: Okay, we are going to show restraint. Because they are things related to life, we need to be careful around them.
